# About Me

Hello! I'm a passionate developer specializing in backend technologies and database management. Here's a brief overview of my skills and expertise:

## Technologies

- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- **NodeJS**: The runtime environment that powers my server-side applications.

## Databases

I have experience working with various database systems, including:

- **SQL Databases**:
  - MySQL
  - PostgreSQL
- **NoSQL Databases**:
  - MongoDB

## ORMs

- **TypeORM**: An ORM that can run in NodeJS and supports both TypeScript and JavaScript.

## What I Do

I specialize in developing robust and scalable backend applications using NestJS and NodeJS. My expertise in database management allows me to design efficient data models and implement complex database operations using SQL databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL, as well as NoSQL solutions like MongoDB.

With my knowledge of TypeORM, I can seamlessly integrate these databases into NestJS applications, ensuring smooth data flow and optimal performance.

Whether it's building RESTful APIs, implementing microservices, or managing large-scale databases, I'm always excited to take on new challenges and create innovative solutions.
