# About Me

Hello! I'm a passionate developer specializing in backend technologies and database management. Here's a quick overview of my expertise:

## Technologies

- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- **NodeJS**: The runtime environment that powers my server-side applications.

## Databases

I have experience working with various database systems:

- **SQL Databases**:
  - MySQL
  - PostgreSQL
- **ORM**:
  - TypeORM: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that makes it easy to link your TypeScript application to a database.
- **NoSQL Databases**:
  - MongoDB: A document-oriented NoSQL database.

## What I Do

I specialize in developing robust and scalable backend applications using NestJS and NodeJS. My expertise in both SQL and NoSQL databases allows me to design and implement efficient data storage solutions tailored to each project's needs.

Whether it's creating RESTful APIs, setting up database schemas, or optimizing queries, I'm committed to delivering high-quality, performant backend solutions.
